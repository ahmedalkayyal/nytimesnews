# NY Times News 

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Initially, this project aims to browse and display the most followed news on NY Times site
Through it, you can view the titles and also know the sections you watch, and when there is any event you want to read, 
you can click on it to open in another window and the full article appears with all its contents.
Of course, there are many challenges to creating such a program, such that not all countries are available to
browse from the NY Times API 
It has also been prepared to make future improvements to the program, such as the search option, 
which will be dedicated to searching between all existing titles
Its installation is very easy, as you can download the program on a device that uses Android and run it immediately
with the presence of the Internet to obtain information and articles
